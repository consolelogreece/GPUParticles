# GPU Based Particles
This is an entirely GPU based particle simulation created for the purpose of learning WebGL.  

[Click here](https://consolelogreece.github.io/GPUParticles/) for live version.

Resources I used when learning WebGL: 
- [WebGL Fundamentals](https://webglfundamentals.org/)
- [Introduction to Computer Graphics Book](https://math.hws.edu/graphicsbook/)
- [Khronos WebGL Specifications & Wiki](https://www.khronos.org/webgl/)
- [Andrew Adamson's YouTube Series](https://www.youtube.com/user/osakaandrew)
- [The book of Shaders](https://thebookofshaders.com/)

Project inspiration and help:
- [Vladimir Agafonkin's WebGL Wind Map](https://blog.mapbox.com/how-i-built-a-wind-map-with-webgl-b63022b5537f)
- [Chris Wellons' A GPU Approach to Particle Physics](https://nullprogram.com/blog/2014/06/29/)

Notes: 
- This is still a work in progress and it doesn't seem to work properly on all devices (phones/tablets).
- At the moment, there are no environemntal collisions but I plan to add that sort of thing later on.
